# Abstract.
abstract = "You may not be aware of it, but your brain is orchestrating a complex ballet of activity while reading this sentence. Whether it is following a dot or reading a sentence; the brain is evaluating input and sending motoric output to perform optimally/efficiently. We can measure this flurry of activity using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Traditional fMRI analysis emphasizes what regions are “activated/deactivated” during a task, but it does not provide information about which regions are acting in synchrony or are being segregated. Knowing the synchronous/segregated brain regions during a task gives insights on the potential organization of the brain. NiBetaSeries seeks to provide information about the organization of the brain by correlating activation/deactivation patterns between brain regions during a task."
