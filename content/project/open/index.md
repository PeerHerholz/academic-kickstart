Starting with the lack of details in the methods section of papers I was reading to no chance of having a look at the data or code (or sometimes even the whole publication) created some sort of frustration I found it hard to cope with. Hence, I'm trying to open up my daily research worklfow as much as possible throughout all stages using a variety of tools (great resource on how to get started can be found here). Through the support during my time as an "open science fellow" I was able to initiate the Open Science Initiative University of Marburg, an university wide organization fostering open science principles for example via hackrooms and hackathons (e.g. brainhacks), workshops (e.g. here), as well as general assistance and support (e.g. here). Additionally, I'm working on integrating comparably new and less know tools like open knowledge maps & scholia into research workflows and how to use virtualization software like docker & singularity for hustle free reproducibility and generalizabillity.
