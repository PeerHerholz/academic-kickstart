As music is as divers as mysterious to such an extent that it's hard or nearly impossible to actually define it, I'm interested how music processing, especially perception, is shaped, how it can be described and possibly explained. To hopefully shed some light on this rather overwhelming question I investigate how human and non-human brains perceive and represent different music genres and how these representations can be explained based on auditory/music features, as well as conceptual and computational models. To do so I apply a broad range of methods, ranging from imaging (MRI & EEG) to behavior to artificial neural networks furthermore including important factors such as development (culture & music preference) and plasticity (musical training). You can find more information about this line of my research on the projects github or OSF page.
Furthermore, I'm working, as a remote contributor, in Harvard's music lab in the amazing Natinal History of Song project.
