I was once told that one doesn't have to understand neuroscience methods and statistics in order to apply. While this is certainly true, it's also certainly bad. Starting with very little method & zero programming skills everything was kinda overwhelming but at the same time fascinating. The combination of math, physics, informatics and biology amazed me and the more I read and gained practical experience the more I wanted to understand. I'm especially insterested in data management and quality control, non-standard experimental setups (e.g., naturalistic stimulation) and acquisition schemes (e.g., multiband, MT), processing steps (e.g., ICA, detrending), image registration, multi-modal measurements & data integretation, as well as multivariate analyses approaches (e.g., machine learning, encoding models). Furthermore, I'm working on pipeline creation / automization and cloud / hpc computing, recently setting up my first own server system.
