Given the importance and prominent role of music for the majortity of people out there, it's quite hard to imaging lacking the ability to actually process or enjoy music. However, for people affected by amusia or musical anhedonia this is reality. While the first have difficulties perceiving and/or producing melodies (pitch) or rhythms (or both) (if you're interested check this great in depth and comprehensive review by Isabelle Peretz), the latter show the incapacity of enjoying listening to music (great introduction, study and overview by Mart√≠nez-Molina et al.). Interestingly, upon a closer look these two show some sort of "double dissociation" in that people affected by amusica can and do enjoy music despite the aforementioned problems, whereas people affected by musical anhedonia have no difficulties in processing music (e.g. it's structure). Hence, I'm very interested in both investigating possible models of explanation combining multimodal data with connectivity measures and multivariate approaches.
