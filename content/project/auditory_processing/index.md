Our normal all day life is full of an ever changing and highly complex soundscape. How and during which time point during auditory perception those countless sound categories emerge in the cortical and subcortical auditory pathway is not only a very interesting, but also challenging question. For a quite a while I'm particulary fascinated by the cortical interaction of music, singing and language, which I investigate through combined MRI & EEG, anazlying subsequent data using different connectivity and machine learning approaches. Additionally, possible factors of influence such as musical training and handedness are an important part of this research question. The project's github and OSF pages provide more information.
