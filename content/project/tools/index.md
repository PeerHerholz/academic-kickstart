Fellow folks working in auditory neuroscience know the somewhat struggle that goes along with that line of research, especially within the realm of MRI: due to the nature of the stimulus experiments can be harder to implement, take way longer SNR is far from being good and whatnot (make sure to check Jonathan Peelle's amazing review on that topic). Hence, working on how experiments can be improved is (like usual) as much as important as actually doing them. Besides the already mentioned ALPACA toolbox, I'm therefore also very interested in improving settings for auditory neuroscience experiments. To this end, I'm e.g., working on MRI aqusition parameters and sequences (for example ISSS & multiband) and a small toolbox that allows audiometry measurements in the MRI environment (corresponding OSF page).
