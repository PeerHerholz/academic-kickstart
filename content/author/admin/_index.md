Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website. My name is Peer and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher  
in cognitive and computational auditory neuroscience partly affiliated with the [Montréal Neurological Institute & Hospital (MNI)](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) located at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) & with the [International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS)](https://www.brams.org/en/) which is jointly run by the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) & [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). More precisely, I work in the [Zatorre](https://www.zlab.mcgill.ca/) & [NeuroDataScience: ORIGAMI](https://neurodatascience.github.io/) labs. Additionally, I'm also affiliated with the [Virtual Data Lab](https://virtualdatalab.github.io/).

I'm interested in how human and non-human brains, as well as machines process sounds, especially music, which I mainly investigate using fMRI and pattern analyses/computational approaches, but more and more also aided by EEG and behavior. Furthermore, I'm interested in the structure and organization of the human auditory pathway, as well as data analysis approaches (e.g., multimodal data integration, alignment methods & statistical learning). All of the above as open, transparent and reproducible as possible.
